        "description": "Undergraduate research project of a computer-powered microscope for classification of sepsis-inducing bacteria using computer vision. I was the lead of the engineering team and had integrated a team of mechanical, electrical, computer and biomedical engineering students to create an actuator-powered automated microscope that moves around in an XY-axis to take pictures of a sample and then applies a deep learning model to classify different bacteria and assess a patient's risk of developing sepsis. This project is still ongoing as of July 2023, the device is ready but we require far more data for our model. I had worked closely with the CMOS image sensor, optics, and image processing of the device. Entire project was made in Simulink and MATLAB with use of Simscape to integrate together all mechanical, electrical and computer systems.",
